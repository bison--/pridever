## Summary
Given a version number **PROUD.DEFAULT.SHAME**, increment the:

1. PROUD version when you make changes you are really proud of  
2. DEFAULT version when you make a release that's okay
3. SHAME version when you are fixing things that are too embarrassing to admit

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **PROUD.DEFAULT.SHAME** format.
